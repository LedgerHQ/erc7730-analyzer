### 🔴 Critical Issues

1. ERC-7730 metadata exposes no fields — it does not show the native ETH amount the user sends (msg.value). For a payable deposit(), msg.value is an input the user expects to see — omission is critical.
2. ERC-7730 does not show the resulting token (WETH) or the received token amount credited by the contract. Final token/amount received is therefore hidden from the user.

### 💡 Recommendations

1. Add a field displaying the ETH sent via path "@.value" with format "amount" (so msg.value is shown).
2. Add a tokenAmount field showing the WETH received (tokenPath pointing to the contract address / tx.to) and/or explicitly reference the WETH token address so the received token and amount are displayed.
