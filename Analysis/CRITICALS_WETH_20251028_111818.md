### 🔴 Critical Issues

1. ERC-7730 format for selector 0xd0e30db0 (deposit()) contains no fields and does not expose msg.value / native ETH amount — this is a payable ETH->WETH-style deposit (contract increases balanceOf[msg.sender]) so users will not see the ETH amount they are sending.
2. No nativeCurrencyAddress / @.value mapping present: display cannot show that the incoming asset is native ETH (or show it as ETH), so final IN amount/token is not displayed.

### 💡 Recommendations

1. Add a field exposing the transaction value: either {"path":"@.value","label":"Amount","format":"amount"} or a tokenAmount field with params.tokenPath set to native sentinel and nativeCurrencyAddress defined.
2. If intent is "Wrap (ETH→WETH)", explicitly show both the native ETH (msg.value) and the resulting WETH credit (or at least clarify that deposit wraps ETH into WETH).
