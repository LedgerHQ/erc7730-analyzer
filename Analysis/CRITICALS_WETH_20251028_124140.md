### 🔴 Critical Issues

1. ERC-7730 metadata has no fields; a payable deposit() accepting msg.value is not showing the ETH amount the user sends (msg.value) — users will not see the actual ETH they are spending.
2. ERC-7730 does not show the received token (WETH) or the received token amount — users will not see that their ETH was wrapped into WETH and for how much.

### 💡 Recommendations

1. Add a field for the native ETH sent: {"path":"@.value","label":"Amount (ETH)","format":"amount"}.
2. Add a field showing WETH received: use a tokenAmount field referencing a constant WETH address (or tokenPath constant) and include nativeCurrencyAddress where appropriate so WETH vs ETH is unambiguous.
