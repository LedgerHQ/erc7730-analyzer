### 🔴 Critical Issues

1. Payable function accepts native ETH (msg.value) but ERC‑7730 format has an empty fields array → the ETH amount the user sends is NOT displayed. This is a critical UI failure: a user can send ETH without the interface showing the amount being transferred.
2. ERC‑7730 does not show the resulting wrapped token credit (the contract mints/credits balanceOf[msg.sender]) — users are not shown what they receive.

### 💡 Recommendations

1. Add an amount field that displays msg.value, e.g. {"path":"@.value","label":"Amount in","format":"amount"} or a tokenAmount with nativeCurrencyAddress.
2. Add a receiving-token field indicating the wrapped token (WETH) and amount credited (tokenAmount tied to the contract/WETH), using nativeCurrencyAddress or an explicit WETH tokenAddress constant.
