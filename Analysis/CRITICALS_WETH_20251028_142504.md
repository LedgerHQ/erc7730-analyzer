### 🔴 Critical Issues

1. Missing display of native ETH amount (msg.value). The ERC-7730 format has an empty fields array for a payable deposit() that takes ETH → users are not shown the amount they send.
2. No indication that ETH is being wrapped to WETH (no outgoing token shown). A payable deposit that mints/increments WETH balance should display both the incoming ETH amount and the resulting WETH credit; it's not shown.

### 💡 Recommendations

1. Add an amount field that references msg.value: e.g. {"path":"@.value","label":"Amount in","format":"amount"} so the ETH the user sends is shown.
2. Add a receive-token field showing WETH credited (tokenAmount with tokenPath hardcoded to WETH contract address or a native sentinel + nativeCurrencyAddress): e.g. tokenAmount referencing WETH constant so user sees "Receive WETH".
