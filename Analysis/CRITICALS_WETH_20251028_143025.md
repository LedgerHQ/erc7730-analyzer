### 🔴 Critical Issues

1. ERC-7730 format has an empty "fields" array for a payable deposit() that mints/credits WETH — the UI will not show the msg.value (ETH amount) the user is sending. Payable function + no amount field → user sees no amount and can be shocked.
2. No display of the received token (WETH) or the credited amount; final token balance change (Deposit event) is present on-chain but not exposed in the format.

### 💡 Recommendations

1. Add a field that displays msg.value (use path "@.value" with format "amount" or a tokenAmount with nativeCurrencyAddress) so ETH sent is visible.
2. Add a field showing the received WETH token amount (tokenAmount referencing the WETH address constant) or otherwise explicitly label that this wraps ETH → WETH.
